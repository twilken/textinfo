##textinfo

* Display the total number of words in a textfile.
* Display the n most frequent words with their respective word count.

### Example usage

Print the 10 most frequent words in dracula.txt:
```
textinfo dracula.txt 10
```

Print the 50 most frequent words in bambi.txt. 50 is the default:
```
textinfo bambi.txt
```

### Why

For me this is part of learning about **golang**, **git** and **github**. Any form of feedback is welcome.
